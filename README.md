# Travelling Salesman Problem Solver - _In Progress_

## Problem Description

Given a set of points, find the shortest path that passes through every point.

## Seems easy?

Yeah, but it's not. It's one of the NP-hard problems (more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness)), which basically means that we do not have an efficient algorithm to do this. In this app, you can see several different approaches towards this problem.

## Running on you own machine

To run the app, just clone the repo and run:

### `npm start`
